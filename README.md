To generate a list of GitHub user's stars by default:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080/{username}
```

Remember to replace the `{username}` placeholder with the actual username.

---

To choose whether or not to show all the programming languages:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080/{username}/{getAllLanguages}

```

Or you can let the list to show only the major language of the starred repositories:

```bash
